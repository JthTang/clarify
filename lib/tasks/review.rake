    CONTENTS = ["Great product. Helped me clear up in days after years of acne. I use it after cleansing with a hypoallergenic facial cleanser and toner. Yeah Iâ€™m a guy and use toner ik. Anyways works great and i get questions on how it happened.", "This stuff is great! Light and watery which absorbs really quickly. The smell is strong but it's very herbal not perfumey and dissipates immediately. It's light enough to wear under your moisturizer before makeup. I use it morning and night and have seen improvements already. I stopped using retinols so my skin is still recovering, this stuff is really soothing without being overly oily or greasy. I will definitely be buying this again.", "I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!! My favorite product that I have tried from this brand thus far. Extremely hydrating and rejuvenating. I also love that it is light weight and not greasy or sticky at all. Absorbs into the skin very well. Leaves my skin feeling very fresh and moisturized. Will be ordering this for the rest of my life!", "Very nourishing & moisturizing. Great after toner and before applying your favorite moisturizer. I would highly recommend the product. Fragrance free which is ideal for all skincare products. Fragrance has no benefits to skin except to irritate or make my face red and sensitive."]
